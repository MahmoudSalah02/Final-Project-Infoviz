    <h1>Project Team Undergraduate 3: Leading Causes of Death in the US, COSI 116A F23</h1>

    <p><strong>Sarah Kaplan</strong>, <strong>Areen Khalaila</strong>,
      <strong>Mahmoud Salah</strong>, and <strong>Paras Pandey</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>Our team’s goal in this project is to explore why people die in the US in modern times, and how 
      different populations are affected differently by those causes of death. We did this by looking 
      at data from the CDC on all deaths that occurred in 2019. Our motivating question is why are people 
      in the US dying, and how do those reasons differ for people of different ages and races? Specifically, 
      we want to examine how different causes of death in the top 10 causes affect different race and age 
      populations. Looking at the charts we created will allow the user a better understanding of American 
      causes of death and how those causes of death proportionately affect certain groups. There is also an 
      opportunity to compare how one cause of death is more common in certain ages or certain races versus 
      another cause. We hope that providing this information will be helpful in some way to people in the 
      medical profession or people who work in legislation in determining how medical practices or legal 
      policy should move forward.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>These are screenshots of our final visualizations when our webpage is opened:</p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/bar.png">
      <img src="images/pie.png">
      <img src="images/tree.png">
    </p>

    <p>When the user highlights a bar (or bars) from the bar chart (one of the causes of death), it highlights to be red, and the pie 
      chart and treemap adjust to show just that cause of death's race and age statistics. We chose to have our bar chart 
      and the treemap all in one color so that the user isn't overwhlemed by irrelevant channels. The pie chart uses multiple 
      colors so that each piece is distinguishable from the others.</p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>The data that we used was the number of deaths in the top 10 causes of death in each age group and race in the US from 
      2019. The data was found on the CDC website (pdfs linked at the bottom of this page) and was initially stored in Excel sheets. 
      It also initially contained death counts based on gender and some other fields, but in preprocessing, we filtered it down 
      to just what we decided was relevant to our project. This data is relevant because it directly answers our question of 
      how people are dying, and how many people of different populations (age-wise and race-wise) are dying, as well as 
      time-appropriate, since 2019 was the last non-COVID-affected year in modern times. In data preprocessing, we took the Excel 
      sheets and deleted the non-relevant fields, then uploaded those new sheets into our project. We then converted the data 
      points into json formatting so that we could use it easily in our visualizations. It is all quantitative data types because 
      it is numbers of deaths in the US population. All of the data (in both the json and CVC formats) can be found in the data 
      folder of this project on GitHub!</p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>On our task table, our tasks were to:
    <ol>
      <li>Explore the prevalence of certain health conditions over time in the US</li>
      <li>Explore the influence of several demographic factors—socioeconomic, age, race—on these health conditions</li>
      <li>Explore health trends as they relate to location (urban vs. rural, regions)</li>
      <li>Investigate US health policies’ effects on these health conditions</li>
    </ol>
    We didn't get to every single one of our tasks, but our top two are here!
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p>We started off by sketching some ideas of what we could do for the project. Then, we 
      adapted our initial sketches into our final sketches and our final sketches into our final 
      visualization on this website. As we progressed through each stage, we tried to balance 
      what was realistic to create and what was interesting for the user to learn about. We especially 
      focused on our use of color, as we discussed in class, and on how to make sure the focus when looking 
      at our visualizations is what we wanted it to be by effective use of marks and channels, and how 
      understandable the content was.</p>

    <p>These are our initial sketches:
      <img src="images/InitialSketch.png">
    </p>

    <p>These are our final sketches:</p>

    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>The final result of our project is a web page that has a bar graph that displays the top 10 causes of 
      death in the US, a pie chart that shows the race breakdown of those deaths, and a treemap that shows the 
      age breakdown of those deaths. When a cause of death (or multiple causes of death) in the bar chart is 
      highlighted, the pie chart and tree map update to show the statistics of those deaths. This visualization 
      effectively explores what causes deaths in the US and how these causes affect different populations differently. 
      The webpage also has a writeup describing the steps of the project and other information on it. In the future, 
      one area of improvement could be attempting to be more creative with our project; because of the quick 
      turnaround time, we were hustling to get everything done, but with more time, we could definitely create a more 
      original project that focuses on more aspects, like what was in the rest of our task table above. This project 
      has been exciting and engaging for our team to work on as a group, and we hope that the user has a meaningful 
      experience looking at our visualizations!</p>
