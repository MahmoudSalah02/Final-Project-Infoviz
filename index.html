    <h1>Project Team Undergraduate 3: Leading Causes of Death in the US, COSI 116A F23</h1>

    <p><strong>Sarah Kaplan</strong>, <strong>Areen Khalaila</strong>,
      <strong>Mahmoud Salah</strong>, <strong>Paras Pandey</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>Our goal is to explore why people die in the US, and how different populations are affected differently by
      those causes of death. Looking at these charts will allow the user a better understanding of American causes
      of death and how those causes of death proportionately affect certain populations.</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation
        slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>The data that we used was numbers of deaths from the top 10 causes of death 
     in each age group and in each race. These were initially in Excel sheets, then we converted
     them into json files so that we could use them easily in our visualizations. All of the data can
     be found in the data folder of this project on GitHub!</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>On our task table, our tasks were to:
      <ol>
        <li>Explore the prevalence of certain health conditions over time in the US</li>
        <li>Explore the influence of several demographic factors—socioeconomic, age, race—on these health conditions</li>
        <li>Explore health trends as they relate to location (urban vs. rural, regions)</li>
        <li>Investigate US health policies’ effects on these health conditions</li>
      </ol>
      We didn't get to every single one of our tasks, but our top two are here!
    </em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p><em>We started off by sketching some ideas of what we could do for the project. Then, we 
      adapted our initial sketches into our final sketches and our final sketches into our final 
      visualization on this website. As we progressed through each stage, we tried to balance 
      what was realistic to create and what was interesting for the user to learn about. We especially 
      focused on our use of color, as we discussed in class, and how understandable the content was.
      
      These are our initial sketches:
      <img src="images/InitialSketch.png">
      These are our final sketches:
      <img src="images/FinalSketch_BarChart.png">
      <img src="images/FinalSketch_PieChart.png">
      <img src="images/FinalSketch_TreeMap.png">
      </em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Our final result is a bar graph that displays the top 10 causes of death in the US, which,
      when a cause is clicked on, creates a pie chart breaking down the races of those deaths and a 
      tree map breaking down the ages of those deaths. This visualization explores what causes deaths
      and how these causes affect different populations differently. In the future, one area of improvement
      could be attempting to be more creative with our project; because of the quick turnaround time, we were
      hustling to get everything done, but with more time, we could definitely create a more original
      project. We also could create more visualizations to display more facets of this data, such as 
      location-related queries.
